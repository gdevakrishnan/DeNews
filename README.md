# DeNews

## Overview
DeNews is a decentralized news verification platform that leverages blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity of news articles. It allows journalists to submit articles, readers to verify their credibility, and rewards or penalties based on the voting outcome.

## Features
- **Decentralized News Submission**: Journalists can submit articles by staking tokens.
- **Community-Based Verification**: Readers can vote on whether an article is real or fake.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Journalists are verified using cryptographic proofs.
- **Automated Reputation System**: Articles with majority "real" votes are verified, while "fake" ones are flagged and penalized.
- **Tokenized Economy**: Users can purchase and stake tokens for participation.
- **Reward and Penalty Mechanism**: Honest voters are rewarded, and fake journalists lose their stake.
- **Immutable Record Keeping**: All actions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

## Token Utility
- **Stake for Article Submission**: Journalists must stake a minimum amount to submit an article.
- **Vote Participation**: Readers must hold tokens to vote on news authenticity.
- **Rewards for Voters**: Correctly identifying fake news earns rewards.
- **Penalty for Fake News**: Journalists submitting fake news lose their staked tokens.
- **Token Purchase Mechanism**: Users can buy platform tokens using ETH.

## Key Metrics
- **Minimum Stake**: 0.0001 DNT
- **Penalty for Fake Articles**: 0.00005 DNT
- **Minimum Votes Required for Verification**: 101
- **Token Exchange Rate**: 1 ETH = 1000 DNT

## Smart Contract Deployment
- **Deployed on**: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0xBf14B1Ff209105aF7cBBb4bd2b32733bc9f859d0`

## How It Works
1. **Journalist Registration**: Journalists must be verified before submitting articles.
2. **Article Submission**: Journalists submit content with a minimum token stake.
3. **Voting System**: Users vote on the article's authenticity.
4. **Verification or Flagging**: If a majority votes it real, the article is verified; otherwise, it's flagged, and penalties apply.
5. **Reward Distribution**: Honest voters receive token rewards.
6. **Token Purchase**: Users can buy tokens using ETH to participate in the ecosystem.
